# Logic Magnets Game

## Overview
This project simulates the Logic Magnets puzzle game, with an AI component that can solve the puzzle using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.

## Game Rules
1. Arrange magnets on the board according to specific rules for magnetic attraction and repulsion.
2. The game is solved when all magnets are in their correct positions.

## Setup and Requirements
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the game using Python 3.
3. Libraries needed: None beyond standard Python libraries.

## Running the Game
To play manually, or allow the AI to solve the game with DFS or BFS, run:
```bash
python main_game.py  # Game 
python algorithms.py  # DFS and BFS 
```
